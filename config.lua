-- 'black_money' -- passed straight to player.Functions.AddMoney/RemoveMoney.

-- GPU TIERS
-- =========================================================================
-- Each tier must correspond to a non-stacking ox_inventory item (see
-- docs/items/ox_inventory.txt) so per-GPU durability can travel as item
-- metadata between inventory and an installed rig slot.
--
-- hashrate      arbitrary units/tick, only meaningful relative to other tiers
-- powerDraw     watts, drives Config.PowerMode cost/generator-capacity math
-- heatPerSecond how fast this GPU raises rig heat while active
-- price         cash cost via the dashboard's Buy GPU screen (server/callbacks.lua's buyGpu)
-- maxCondition  durability ceiling (0-100); GPUs are damaged by overheating
-- requiredLevel mining skill level needed before this tier is buyable -- see
--               Config.Skill below. Tiers at level 1 are available immediately.

-- 20 tiers on a single "ANX" GPU line, spaced across the full 1-25 level
-- range (see Config.Skill below) so there's almost always a new card to
-- chase. Stats compound roughly geometrically tier-to-tier (~12-25% per
-- step depending on the stat) rather than a flat curve, so the jump from
-- a tier01 to a tier20 rig feels dramatic rather than incremental.
-- `rank` is the 1-20 position on the line, used by Config.RigModels' chassis
-- compatibility window (minGpuRank/maxGpuRank) -- a chassis only accepts GPUs
-- whose rank falls inside its window, so a desktop can't run an enterprise
-- card and a data-centre node isn't wasted on entry-level silicon. Keep rank
-- contiguous and unique if you add/re-order tiers.

-- COMPONENTS / ASSEMBLY  (server/components.lua + Assembly tab)
-- =========================================================================
-- A placed rig chassis is now an EMPTY shell -- it won't mine until the owner
-- physically assembles it from parts, one at a time, each with its own install
-- minigame. The four `required` categories (motherboard, CPU, RAM, PSU) must
-- all be present before the rig can power on; cooling is optional but lowers
-- heat. GPUs are still handled by Config.GpuTiers (installed on the Assembly'd
-- board) and provide the actual hashrate.
--
-- Every category -> minigame mapping is here, so each part feels different to
-- fit:
--   sequence  memorise + repeat a node pattern   (Simon-says grid)
--   pins      rotate the part and seat it in the socket window (timing)
--   latch     clip the two DIMM latches in rhythm (two-stage timing)
--   cables    match each power lead to its socket  (wiring)
--   sweep     the classic "strike inside the moving zone" timing bar
--
-- Server-authority note: installing a part you own into a rig you own isn't an
-- economy exploit the way stealing is, so these assembly minigames are
-- resolved client-side (skipping one just installs a part you already paid
-- for). The SERVER still enforces everything that matters: you own the rig,
-- you're next to it, you own the item, the category slot is empty, and the
-- dependency order (a board before anything mounts on it). The theft hack
-- stays fully server-validated (server/theft.lua).
--
-- Each tier entry maps to a non-? ox_inventory item (see
-- docs/items/ox_inventory.txt). Add tiers freely; `item` must be unique.
